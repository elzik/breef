        Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my
        purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little
        and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and
        regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
        whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
        pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and
        especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
        principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
        people''s hats off - then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my
        substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his
        sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it,
        almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
        towards the ocean with me.
